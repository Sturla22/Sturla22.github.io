Chapter 5 of [OSVVM's Test Writer's User Guide](https://github.com/OSVVM/Documentation/blob/master/OSVVM_test_writers_user_guide.pdf) explains how their testbench framework consists of a test sequencer, TestCtrl, and a top level testbench which they call a test harness. However, no examples are given on how to create this setup. I resorted to digging around in OSVVM's own testbenches to find out how to do that. This post will cover how to create your own setup of the testbench framework with a test controller.

{% assign figure_num = 1 %}
{% assign listing_num = 1 %}

{% include toc.html %}

This setup is entirely overkill for simple designs, but perhaps appropriate for board- or system-level testbenches i.e. testbenches going beyond the Affirm/Check/Asserts of self checking testbenches but rather testbenches that can get up to tens of thousands of lines and are checking the integration of several components for example.

The architecture of testbenches tends towards something like the following image:

{%
  include image.html
  dir="/assets/img/"
  file="Classic_Testbench.png"
  figure_num=figure_num
  description="Classic testbench"
%}
{% assign figure_num = figure_num | plus: 1 %}

With OSVVM's approach of using a Test Controller to separate the test harness and the test cases we get a clear interface to the design under test (DUT).

{%
  include image.html
  dir="/assets/img/"
  file="Test_Controller.png"
  figure_num=figure_num
  description="Test Controller"
%}
{% assign figure_num = figure_num | plus: 1 %}


## Template

I based this template on the tests in [OSVVM's UART verification component](https://github.com/OSVVM/UART/blob/ec0e17f6622145173754d6b56f78d86cf92cd249/testbench/TbUart_Checkers1.vhd). To use the template, clone [this repository](https://github.com/sturla22/osvvm_advanced_template) and follow the instructions in the readme. You can see a usage example [at the end of this post](#example).

### Test Controller

We'll start with the test control entity which provides a configuration point later on for hooking in you test cases.

{%
  include vhdl_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Template for test controller"
  dir="includes/vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller/osvvm-advanced-usage-template/example/"
  file="test_controller.vhd"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

### Test Harness

The test harness serves the purpose of connecting the design under test to the test controller. This leads to a reusable setup which is useful for large designs with complicated setups, like board-level simulations.

{%
  include vhdl_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Template for test harness"
  dir="includes/vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller/osvvm-advanced-usage-template/example/"
  file="test_harness.vhd"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

### Test Case

In the test case you finally implement your test code. As you can see in the listing below I have numbered the file, this is an indication that we can create multiple test cases and reuse the harness and controller.

{%
  include vhdl_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Template for a test case"
  dir="includes/vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller/osvvm-advanced-usage-template/example/"
  file="test_case_1.vhd"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

## Example

Let's have a go at filling in the template for a half adder design from [nandland](https://www.nandland.com/vhdl/modules/module-half-adder.html) which I used [in]({% post_url 2021-03-27-vunit %}) [previous]({% post_url 2021-03-15-vhdl-style-guide %}) [posts]({% post_url 2021-03-25-ghdl %}). To reiterate my point from above, this is a complete overkill for such a simple design.

{%
  include vhdl_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Example design"
  dir="includes/vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller/half_adder/"
  file="half_adder.vhd"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

The filled-in template follows, I've kept most of the template comments to highlight what changes I made when instantiating the template.

### Test Controller

I've basically copied the port definition from the design, but set the port mode to inout on all ports.

{%
  include vhdl_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Example test controller"
  dir="includes/vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller/half_adder/"
  file="test_controller.vhd"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

### Test Harness

For the test harness you copy the `test_controller` entity port definitions into the `test_controller` component, define the signals needed for the ports and finally connect the ports of the `test_controller` to your design.

{%
  include vhdl_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Example test harness"
  dir="includes/vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller/half_adder/"
  file="test_harness.vhd"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

### Test Cases

The test case file is where the manual labor stops and you need to start thinking about how to test your design. I've really only added the stimulation and checks in the `check_process` here.

{%
  include vhdl_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Example test case"
  dir="includes/vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller/half_adder/"
  file="test_case_1.vhd"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

{%
  include vhdl_code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Example test case"
  dir="includes/vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller/half_adder/"
  file="test_case_2.vhd"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

### Running

OSVVM provides scripts to run testbenches. Follow their documentation at [github](https://github.com/OSVVM/Documentation/blob/master/Script_user_guide.pdf).

`tclsh` will open the tcl shell. Running `source Scripts/StartUp.tcl` from within the [OsvvmLibraries repository](https://github.com/OSVVM/OsvvmLibraries) will set up an environment for running testbenches.

Create a `sim` directory and `cd` into it. Build the osvvm core library with `build ../osvvm/osvvm.pro`. Then `cd` into a directory containing the example and run `build half_adder`.
This will run the `half_adder.pro` file shown in the listing {{ listing_num | plus: 1 }}:

{%
  include code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="OSVVM Project File"
  dir="includes/vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller/half_adder/"
  file="half_adder.pro"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

Running `half_adder.pro` will result in

{%
  include code_snippet.html
  listing_num=listing_num
  description="Example test case"
  dir="includes/vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller/half_adder/logs/GHDL-1.0.0/"
  file="vhdl-design-patterns-test-controller_half_adder.log"
%}
{% assign listing_num = listing_num | plus: 1 %}

OSVVM's output is on lines 7, 10 and 11 above, showing that there was an alert at 2 ns and that there was one error in the second test case.

## Conclusion

This approach is not entirely dependent on OSVVM, it is a design pattern. But OSVVM pushes this design pattern and their synchronization methods make the implementation a lot easier than implementing these yourself. The design pattern itself is a clever way to get around either copy-pasting a lot of setup code for different tests of the same integration, or keeping the setup and all of the test cases in a single, _enormous_, file.

## Change Log

### 2021-09-13
Finally got around to fixing this post, which originally showed a non working VUnit run script since [VUnit does not support configurations](https://github.com/VUnit/vunit/issues/179).

### 2021-04-08
I've updated the VUnit run-script to align with VUnit's [Distributed Testbenches](https://vunit.github.io/run/user_guide.html#distributed-testbenches) example instead of hacking around with attributes.
